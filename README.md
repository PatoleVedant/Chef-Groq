# Chef Claude (Chef-Groq)

A small React + Vite app that suggests recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand by calling the Groq chat completions API. Enter ingredients, then generate a Markdown-formatted recipe produced by a Groq LLM.

This project is a lightweight demo / prototype and is intended to show how to integrate a client-side UI with Groq's chat completions endpoint. For production usage you should move the request to a server-side component and never expose secret keys in client bundles.

## Features

- Simple React + Vite front-end
- Enter ingredients and maintain an ingredient list
- Once you have a few ingredients, request a recipe generated by a Groq model
- Recipe is rendered as Markdown using `react-markdown`

---

## Quick start

Requirements
- Node.js (18+ recommended)
- npm (or your preferred package manager)
- A Groq API key

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PatoleVedant/Chef-Groq.git
   cd Chef-Groq
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Add your Groq API key to a `.env` file at the project root:
   ```
   VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```
   Note: the repo's `.gitignore` already ignores `.env`.

4. Run the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:5173 (or the URL printed by Vite) in your browser.

## Development / Usage notes

- Add ingredients in the input and click "+ Add Ingredient".
- The "Get a recipe" button appears when you have more than 3 ingredients (this is configurable in `src/ingredientList.jsx` — it uses `props.ingredient.length > 3`).
- When you click "Get a recipe" the app calls `getRecipeFromGroq` from `ai.js`, which POSTs to:
  `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
  using the model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and the system/user messages in `ai.js`.
- The returned recipe is displayed as Markdown using `react-markdown`.

## Important files

- src/App.jsx — root app component
- src/Body.jsx — main UI: ingredient form, triggers recipe retrieval
- src/ingredientList.jsx — ingredient list + "Get a recipe" button
- src/claudeRecipe.jsx — renders recipe Markdown
- src/Header.jsx — header/logo
- src/index.css — styling
- ai.js — responsible for calling the Groq API (client-side)
- package.json — scripts and deps
- vite.config.js — Vite config

---

## Environment & security considerations

- This project currently calls the Groq API directly from the browser. That requires shipping `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` to the client which is insecure.
- For production: implement a server-side endpoint (serverless function or API route) that holds the API key and forwards requests to Groq. The client should call your server endpoint instead.
- Keep `.env` out of source control (already listed in `.gitignore`).

Sample `.env` (do not commit):
```
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=sk-...
```

---

## Scripts

- npm run dev — start development server
- npm run build — build for production
- npm run preview — preview the production build
- npm run lint — run eslint

---

## Troubleshooting

- If recipe requests fail with CORS or network errors, ensure:
  - Your API key is valid.
  - You are not blocked by browser CORS policies (server-side proxy recommended).
  - The Groq endpoint and model name are available for your API key / account.
- If the recipe never shows, check the browser console — `ai.js` logs errors and returns a fallback message on failure.
